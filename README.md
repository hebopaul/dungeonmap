This is an **unfinished project** of an Jetpack Compose app that acts as a playing field for tabletop RPG games.
The main goal was for network functionality to be added using Nearby Devices API, but it hasn't been implemented. 

You can choose your playing map, and add or remove tokens, both of which you can also import from your phone, and then 
drag around, resize etc.

I have implemented an initiative tracking system where each token "casts" a 20 sided die, after which all the tokens are placed 
on top of the screen in order of who's playing first.

There's also a system to add helping shapes on the playing field, but it doesn't work as intended.
